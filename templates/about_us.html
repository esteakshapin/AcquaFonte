            <div style:text-align=center id="aboutUs">
                At Acqua Fonte, we believe that we can give people the most convenient alternate to single-use plastic water bottles, which contribute to nearly 40% of our plastic waste, equivalent to over 60 million plastic bottles per day. We can provide the means to a world where everybody can contribute to help the community, as well as others outside of the community, into a new world where single-use plastics won't dominate our decisions. We can be a catalyst for people to help sustain our environment for future generations to come. We truly believe that we can change the world, one bottle at a time.

                <br><br>Finding water has been a problem thatâ€™s been around for thousands of years. Our service allows our users to easily locate free water sources near them. At the same time, reducing the need for single-use bottles that get thrown out, and therefore reducing the pollution that ends up in our ecosystems and oceans. We may not be able to change much as individuals, but when we work as a collective body to achieve a common goal, much more can be accomplished.
